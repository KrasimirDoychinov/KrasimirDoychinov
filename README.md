**`All things code enthusiast (Back-end developer/Tutor)`**

Hey there,
I'm a back-end developer (1.5 years professional experience), who creates, tests and optimizes back-end code. I've worked on small, medium and large projects. Everything from **large e-commerce, SalesForce type of clone, mobile apps for yoga and food, government financial sites and a pharmaceutical information site**.
I'm a sucker for clean and reliable code and I keep myself and my colleagues to the highest possible standard for such things.
I'm passionate about learning and trying out new things, that's what pushes me to always one up myself everyday.
