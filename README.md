**`All things code enthusiast (Back-end developer/Tutor)`**

Hey there,
I'm a back-end developer (1.5 years professional experience), who creates, tests and optimizes back-end code. I've worked on small, medium and large projects. Everything from **large e-commerce, SalesForce type of clone, mobile apps for yoga and food, government financial sites and a pharmaceutical information site**.
I'm a sucker for clean and reliable code and I keep myself and my colleagues to the highest possible standard for such things.
I'm passionate about learning and teaching things to others, I've been a private tutor to several people for the last couple of months.
